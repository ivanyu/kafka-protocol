Apache Kafka protocol
=====================

Apache Kafka protocol implementations generated for different languages based on Kafka code. It's done the similar way as Kafka does for Java.

At the moment, it's implemented for Rust (see in [rust/](rust/) and [RustMessageGenerator.java](java/org/apache/kafka/message/RustMessageGenerator.java)).
